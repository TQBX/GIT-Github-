##### 解决以下问题：

```git
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:TQBX/GIT-Github-.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

```

- `git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories`

- 进入`vim`界面->`ESC`->`:wq`

- 重复第一步->`git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories`

- ```git
  From github.com:TQBX/GIT-Github-
   * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
  Already up to date.
  ```

  出现这个情况即pull完成

- `git push origin master`->成功！
